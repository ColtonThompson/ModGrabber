### What does ModGrabber do?

ModGrabber downloads a list of Mod (music) files from [ModArchive.org](http://ModArchive.org)'s API to your computer uncompressed.

### How does it work?

ModGrabber reads the modlist.txt file and downloads each file from each link you provide to the Mods folder inside the application directory. ModArchive's API has a download restriction of 20,000 mods per hour.

### How big is the current mod list?

The Modlist provided in the latest release (v1.0) contains over 10,000 mods to download.
